## Hellooo, I'm LÃ©o ðŸ‘‹
In 2020, I began learning the fundamentals of programming (algorithms, logic, and OOP) using the Java language. In 2021, I achieved my long-awaited promotion to Delphi Desktop Programmer at Siscart Sistemas.

Now, in 2024, I am more determined than ever to focus on consolidating and improving my skills in Java. My goal is to change my career path to work as a Java developer, particularly in the back-end area. This decision reflects not only my passion for the Java language but also my aspiration to pursue a career more aligned with my interests and professional goals.
